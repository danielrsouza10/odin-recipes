        <h1>Cupcakes</h1>
        <h2>Descripm</h2>
        <p>While cake itself in some form or another has been around since ancient times, 
            cupcakes first came about in America.  
            It is thought that the first ever reference to a cake to be baked in small cups,
             rather than as a layer cake, was in Amelia Simmons American Cookery in 1796. The
              first reference to the word cupcake is said to be from a 19th century American
               author named Eliza Leslie in her cookbook Receipts. Font: <a href="https://hummin

                <li>½ cup milk</li>
                <li>½ cup vegetable oil</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon vanilla extract</li>
                <li>3 large eggs</li>
                <li>¾ cup sour cream</li>
                <li>2 ½ cups all-purpose flour</li>
                <li>2 cups white sugar</li>
                <li>¾ cup unsweetened cocoa powder</li>
                <li>1 ½ teaspoons baking soda</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <p>
            <ol>
                <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease two 12-cup 
                    muffin tins or line cups with paper liners.</li>
                <li>Whisk stout beer, milk, vegetable oil, and vanilla extract together in
                     a bowl until evenly blended. Beat in eggs 1 at a time, beating well 
                     after each addition. Mix in sour cream. Whisk together flour, sugar,
                      cocoa powder, and baking soda in a separate bowl. Gradually mix the
                       flour mixture ingredients into the beer mixture.</li>
                <li>Spoon cupcake batter into the prepared muffin cups, filling each 3/4 full.</li>
                <li>Bake in the preheated oven until cupcakes are risen and set in the 
                    middle but still soft and tender, about 25 minutes. Cool in the tins,
                     then transfer to a wire rack to cool completely, about 1 hour.</li>
                <li>Whisk cocoa powder and stout beer together in a bowl. Beat in butter
                     and cream cheese using an electric mixer until well combined. Gradually
                      beat in confectioners' sugar, 1 cup at a time, until frosting has 
                      desired sweetness. Spread or pipe frosting onto cooked cupcakes.</li>
